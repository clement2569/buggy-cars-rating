Test Approach:

The test approach was mainly to perform manual unit tests to verify the main functionality offered on the site, including registration, login and voting, in the perspective of a user.

This involved manually testing and identifying any defects and prioritizing these to find the most critical issues and/or processes present and then also creating automated tests to quickly retest these items.  These tests consisted of mainly unit tests and integration tests where applicable.

Also tested with different browsers including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edgeand considered mobile tests (due to lack of devices, only had an Android to check)
